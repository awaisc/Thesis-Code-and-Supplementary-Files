In this folder is the following files

MGI (Mammailian genome phenotype Enrichement) Results for both human and mouse genes that were predicted targets of ARX/Arx
GO (GO Bioloigcal processes Enrichement Results) Results for both human and mouse genes that were predicted targets of ARX/Arx


For each genome, the enrichement results are divided into 2 seperate lists, one list is the nehancer targets and the other is the Promoter targets


eg: GO HumanEnhancerTargets.txt: Gene ontology results for genes that were predicted to be targets of ARX TFBS in Enhancer regions in the human genome

 MousePromotersARX.txt : Mammalian genome phenotype enrichement results for genes that were predicted to be targets of Arx TFBS in enhancer regions in the mouse genome
